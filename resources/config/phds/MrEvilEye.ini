name = MrEvilEye
bio = I'm Mirco, from Italy, and I'm helping Vito with Pauperformance! I'm very proud of having taught him how to play Magic, in our university years, and seeing his passion for the game blossoming. I enjoy playing with paper cards, more than with their digital brothers. I like to play with powerful cards, in crappy decks!
