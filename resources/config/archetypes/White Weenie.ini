  White Weenie is a versatile go-wide deck that can vary from aggro to midrange depending on the build and the current metagame.
  It can compete with both aggressive and more controlling/combo based decks, often going over the top of faster decks like burn using versatile removal and life gain, while also going under slower decks by going wide and beating down.

  The deck is further augmented by powerful mainboard and sideboard answers, combined with an impressive suite of card draw to dig for crucial answers or additional gas in the mid/late game.
  Versatile answers such as Journey to Nowhere and Dawnbringer Cleric in the maindeck ensure that you have potential answers to a wide range of threats at all times, and powerful sideboard effects such as Dust to Dust can swing matchups wildly.
  Powerful threats like Battle Screech can also stop certain common decks in their tracks.
  Depending on what other decks are currently seeing play, white also has access to cards such as Holy Light and Prismatic Strands which can be incredibly effective against certain decks.

  Furthermore, without a second color, the deck is able to play useful utility within its mana base.
  Cards such as Radiant Fountain and Desert are easily playable in a small number despite not producing colored mana and can swing a matchup in the right place.
  Similarly, cycling lands like Secluded Steppe can be played to help prevent late-game flood if necessary.

  Over all, while the deck's vulnerability to common answers such as fiery cannonade can be an issue, the deck is impressively resilient even after multiple wipes/removal spells.
  Individual threats are very replaceable and a large percentage of the deck's cards such as Inspiring Overseer and Battle Screech can quickly reestablish a board state.
  The primary weakness of the deck is controlling decks that can compete on the board while also going over the top of what the deck is capable of.
  Familiars and other Ephemerate decks in particular can pose a serious problem since the deck is not fast enough to go under them and unlikely to out value them in the late game.
