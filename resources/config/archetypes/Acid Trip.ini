  Acid Trip is a midrange deck revolving around the card [Reality Acid](https://scryfall.com/card/tsr/81/reality-acid).
  The enchantment is used to repeatedly force the opponent to sacrifice key permanents.

  To speed-up the engine, the player tries to [bounce](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Bounce) Reality Acid without waiting for the [Vanishing](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Vanishing) ability to resolve after the 3rd upkeep.
  Several cards can cause Reality Acid to [leave the battlefield](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Leaves_the_battlefield), such as [Kor Skyfisher](https://scryfall.com/card/mm3/11/kor-skyfisher), [Teferi's Time Twist](https://scryfall.com/card/war/72/teferis-time-twist), [Aethersnipe](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/44/aethersnipe), [Dream Stalker](https://scryfall.com/card/tsr/63/dream-stalker), and [Drake Familiar](https://scryfall.com/card/rav/44/drake-familiar).
  Bounce effects are also used directly on the opponent's permanents whenever possible to control the board.

  Once the board is in control, the player typically wins by beating with creatures like [Seeker of the Way](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/29/seeker-of-the-way) and [Mulldrifter](https://scryfall.com/card/khc/42/mulldrifter).
