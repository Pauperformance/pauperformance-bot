  Mono White Heroic is an explosive aggro deck based around cheap white creatures with the [Heroic](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Heroic) ability, such as [Lagonna-Band Trailblazer](https://scryfall.com/card/jou/14/lagonna-band-trailblazer) and [Akroan Skyguard](https://scryfall.com/card/bng/3/akroan-skyguard).
  The deck bets on a protective buff strategy where the player can protect their creatures while leveraging the Heroic ability to create big creatures and win in the first 4-5 turns.
  Staples of the archetype are [Cartouche of Solidarity](https://scryfall.com/card/akh/7/cartouche-of-solidarity), [Hyena Umbra](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/20/hyena-umbra), [Benevolent Blessing](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/13/benevolent-blessing), and the catalyser of all: [Ethereal Armor](https://scryfall.com/card/rtr/9/ethereal-armor).
  Auras are the core of the deck, but anything that targets and protects are welcome to the strategy (with the trade-off of not contributing to [Ethereal Armor](https://scryfall.com/card/rtr/9/ethereal-armor)), and the deck also leverage some instants. [Defiant Strike](https://scryfall.com/card/m21/15/defiant-strike) brings a bit of buff and card advantage, [Emerge Unscathed](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/19/emerge-unscathed) brings more protection and [Karametra's Blessing](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/26/karametras-blessing) brings both!
  Since Mono White Heroic creatures are usually protected on turn 2-3, opponents are left with a few options to deal with them.
  The most common way of dealing with them is sacrifice effects, such as [Chainer's Edict](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/89/chainers-edict) or be fast enough to kill creatures before they get the needed protection. The opponent may also rely on [Standard bearer](https://scryfall.com/card/apc/18/standard-bearer) to mostly disable the deck's strategy.
  Some extra creatures are usually added to get enough good body count. [Benevolent Bodyguard](https://scryfall.com/card/ema/4/benevolent-bodyguard) is used to provide extra creatures to avoid [Chainer's Edict](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/89/chainers-edict), while still providing extra protection, and [Deftblade Elite](https://scryfall.com/card/vma/23/deftblade-elite) is a good way to deal with the lack of removals.
  Mono White Heroic has very few interactions, a fast clock, low mana curve and all-in strategy that doesn't offer many mid/late-game options.
  It's probably the cheaper competitive deck in the format.
