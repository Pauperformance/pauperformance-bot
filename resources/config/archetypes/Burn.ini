description =
  Burn is a very aggressive deck trying to optimally chain a series of spells to directly damage the opponent.
  The deck relies on few creatures that often amplify the damage caused by other spells, such as [Thermo-Alchemist](https://scryfall.com/card/mid/164/thermo-alchemist).
  For this reason, they are often played in the early turns of the game.

  Burn looks easy to play, but it requires careful sequencing and sometimes a lot of patience to play around counterspells.
  Tough decisions for Burn players also involve choosing whether to use removals on creatures or directly target the opponent.
