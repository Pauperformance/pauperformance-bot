  Walls is a deck based around the mana generation capability of [Overgrown Battlement](https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/417/overgrown-battlement) and [Axebane Guardian](https://scryfall.com/card/rtr/115/axebane-guardian), that both produce mana equal to the total amount of [defenders](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Defender) the player controls.
  Two main versions of the deck exists, with many sub-versions: combo and [cascade](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Cascade).
  The first version is a pure combo deck that allows to kill through infinite damage usually by turn 4, or to mill the opponent.
  Key cards to enable the combo are [Galvanic Alchemist](https://scryfall.com/card/avr/54/galvanic-alchemist), [Freed from the Real](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/58/freed-from-the-real), and [Secret Door](https://scryfall.com/card/afr/71/secret-door).
  The second version aims at quickly putting into play [Boarding Party](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/163/boarding-party) and [Annoyed Altisaur](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/216/annoyed-altisaur), overwhelming the opponent on the board by turn 4-5.
  A hybrid version of the two exists, with main deck cascade that can transform into combo with a transformational sideboard.
