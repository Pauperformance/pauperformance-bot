# Pauper Pool

This page shows how the pool of legal Pauper cards has increased over time.

Every group lists common cards that were introduced in the format (and that are currently not banned).
These cards can be new cards or downshifts, while reprints are excluded.

This page should be useful for Pauper players that haven't followed the latest releases and would like to be informed on what has recently changed.

Further information about reference numbers used by Pauperformance (p12e) to uniquely identify Magic sets can be found in the [Set Index page]({{ set_index_page }}).

The total number of cards in the Pauper pool is: {{ tot_cards_number }}.
