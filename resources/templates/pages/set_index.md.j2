# Set Index

The following table provides the reference numbers used by Pauperformance (p12e) to uniquely identify Magic sets.

The table is automatically generated using [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/sets).
Due to Magic's long and complicated history, Scryfall includes many un-official sets as a way to group promotional or outlier cards together.

For this reason, the set index looks different from other versions available online, such as the one in the [Magic: The Gathering Wiki](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Set#List_of_Magic_expansions_and_sets).

However, this index is built in a cross-format, stable, backward- and forward-compatible way and is thus preferred.

Pauperformance decks use the **p12e code** as identifier.

Lines in **bold** correspond to sets that have introduced new cards in the [Pauper Pool]({{ pauper_pool_page }}).

| p12e code | Scryfall code | Set name                                        | Release date |
| ----------| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
{% for set in index -%}
| {{ "%-10s" % set.p12e_code -}} | {{ "%-13s" % set.scryfall_code }} | {{ "%-47s" % set.name }} | {{ "%-12s" % set.date }} |
{% endfor %}
